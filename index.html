    <!-- Story of Ken Griffey Jr's career -->
    <div class="body">
      <p>Ken Griffey Jr. was my favorite baseball player growing up. Period. End of story. I idolized him. That swing;
        oh my gosh that swing. It helped that I also swing the bat left-handed. I emlulated that swing more times than
        I can count.</p>
      <p>Ken Griffey Jr. began his career with the Seattle Mariners in 1989. He was drafted first overall in the Major
        League Baseball Amateur Draft held on June 2, 1987. Starting in 1990, he made the all-star team for ten
        straight years until 2000. He averaged
        38 home runs and 110 runs batted in per season during that stretch.</p>
      <p>In his eleven seasons with Seattle (1989–1999) Griffey established himself as one of the most prolific and
        exciting players of the era, racking up 1,752 hits, 398 home runs, 1,152 RBIs, and 167 stolen bases. He led the
        American League in home runs
        for four seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, and 1999), was voted the A.L. MVP in 1997, and maintained a .297 career
        batting average. In his first major league at-bat, he doubled. His defense in center field was widely
        considered the standard of elite
        fielding during the decade, exemplified by his streak of 10 straight Gold Gloves from 1990–1999. His impressive
        range allowed frequent spectacular diving plays, and he often dazzled fans with over-the-shoulder basket
        catches and robbed opposing
        hitters of home runs by leaping up and pulling them back into the field of play. He was featured on the
        Wheaties cereal box and had his own signature sneaker line from Nike, Inc.</p>
      <p>On April 3, 1989, in his very first MLB plate appearance, Griffey hit a line drive double off Oakland
        Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart at the Oakland Coliseum. One week later in his first at-bat at the Kingdome,
        Griffey hit his first major league
        home run. Griffey was a frequent participant in the All-Star Game during the 1990s. He led his league multiple
        times in different hitting categories. In 1990 and 1991, Griffey and his father became the first son and father
        to play on the same
        team at the same time. In his father's first game as a Mariner, on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back
        singles in the first inning and both scored. On September 14, the pair hit back-to-back home runs in the top of
        the first off California
        Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, becoming the first father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs. The duo played
        a total of 51 games together before Griffey Sr. retired in June 1991.</p>
      <p>At the MLB Home Run Derby in 1993, which was held at Oriole Park in Baltimore, Griffey hit the warehouse
        beyond the right field wall on the fly and he is still the only player ever to do so. As with every home run
        that hits Eutaw Street, each feat
        is honored with a circular plaque, embedded horizontally onto the concourse's walkway, in the exact spot where
        the home run landed. In 1994, he led the league in voting for All Star game selection. That season, which ended
        prematurely on August
        12 due to the labor dispute, saw Griffey hit 30 home runs in the Mariners' first 65 games. He would go on to
        have 4 multi-home run games that year. While his pace cooled somewhat in the final eight weeks of the season
        (he only hit 10 home runs
        in the Mariners' last 47 games), his 40 home runs by August 12 still put him two ahead of Chicago's Frank
        Thomas and four ahead of Cleveland's Albert Belle for the AL lead.</p>
      <p>One of the most memorable moments of Griffey's career with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League
        Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, the Mariners and Griffey
        were on the verge of elimination,
        but came back to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom of the 11th inning of
        Game 5, with Griffey on first base, teammate Edgar Martínez hit a double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid
        into home with the winning
        run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. The 1995 AL Division Series would kick off a brief
        rivalry between the Yankees and the Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that he would never play
        for the Yankees, because
        the Yankees allegedly treated his father, Ken Griffey Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting his dad
        in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing that children did not belong in the
        clubhouse, kick him out of
        there. Although the Mariners subsequently lost the ALCS to the Cleveland Indians (managed by later Mariners
        manager Mike Hargrove), that moment remains one of the most memorable in Mariners history, capping a season
        that "saved baseball in Seattle",
        Seattle's improbable late season playoff run that year, spurred by the return of Griffey from injury, led to
        the construction of Safeco Field and the future security of a franchise rumored for years to be on the move.
        The play also inspired the
        title of the video game Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run for the Super NES.</p>
      <p>In 1997, Griffey led the Mariners to the AL West crown and captured the American League Most Valuable Player
        Award, hitting .304, with 56 home runs and 147 RBIs. The next season, 1998, was a season which was followed
        closely by the national media
        as both Griffey and Mark McGwire entered the summer ahead of the pace of Roger Maris' home run record of 61.
        Despite Griffey falling short, Major League Baseball put forth an effort to draw a new set of young fans and
        regain those disenchanted
        by the 1994 strike focused on McGwire, Sosa, and Griffey's pursuit of Maris' record. Griffey, however, fell out
        of the spotlight due to some nagging injuries and was surpassed by Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who
        finished with 66 home runs,
        himself falling short of McGwire's then record 70. Despite falling out of the record chase, Griffey nearly
        duplicated his 1997 statistics, finishing with 56 home runs and 146 RBI.</p>
      <p>In 1999, he ranked 93rd on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. This list was
        compiled during the 1998 season, counting only statistics through 1997. At age 29 (going on 30), he was the
        youngest player on the list. That
        same year, Griffey was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when TSN updated their
        list for a new book in 2005, despite having surpassed 400 and 500 home runs, Griffey remained at Number 93.</p>
      <p>While playing with Seattle, Griffey was a 10-time American League Gold Glove winner, the 1992 All-Star Game
        MVP, 1997 AL MVP, 1998 ESPY co-winner for Male Athlete of the Year, 1999 Players Choice Awards Player of the
        Decade (by the players), and
        was named to the All-Century team in 1999.</p>
      <p>Citing a desire to be closer to his family and to be able to raise his kids, Griffey expressed a desire to
        return to Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 10, 2000, Ken Griffey Jr. was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for pitcher
        Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike
        Cameron, and minor leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer.</p>
      <p>The 2000 season began what has generally been seen by the media as a decline in Griffey's superstar status.
        Although his statistics during this season were respectable, they were far below his previous level of play: in
        145 games, Griffey hit .271
        with 40 home runs, but his .943 on-base plus slugging was his lowest mark in five years. In 2000, Griffey also
        changed his number from 24 to 30, the number his father wore while playing in both Cincinnati and Seattle. The
        number 24 was already
        retired in honor of Tony Pérez. Additionally, from 2001 through 2004, Griffey was plagued by a string of
        injuries, including season-ending injuries in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Worse yet for Griffey, the cumulative
        effects of the injuries lowered
        his bat speed, resulting in less power and fewer home runs (he slugged only .426 before succumbing to injury in
        2002, his lowest output in seven years). Injuries forced Griffey to miss 260 out of 486 games from 2002 through
        2004, diminishing both
        his skills and his star reputation.</p>
      <p>In 2004, Griffey avoided major injury during the first half of the season, and on June 20 became the 20th
        player to hit 500 career home runs. His 500th home run came on Father's Day in a game against the St. Louis
        Cardinals at Busch Stadium, with
        his father in the stands; the homer tied Griffey with his father in career hits with 2,143. However, the injury
        bug bit again just before the All-Star break; he suffered a partial hamstring tear, knocking him out of the
        All-Star Game and putting
        him on the disabled list yet again.</p>
      <p>Griffey finished the 2004 season on the disabled list after suffering a rupture of his right hamstring in San
        Francisco. The play in question occurred at AT&T Park in a game against the San Francisco Giants. Griffey was
        starting in right field for
        the first time in his 16-year Major League career when he raced toward the gap to try to cut off a ball before
        it got to the wall. He slid as he got to the ball, but in the process hyper-extended his right leg, tearing the
        hamstring completely
        off the bone. He later came out of the game, complaining of "tightness" in the hamstring exacerbated by chilly
        conditions in San Francisco. However, there was far more to it than anyone realized at the time.</p>
      <p>Shortly after this injury, the Reds' team physician, Timothy Kremchek, devised an experimental surgery dubbed
        "The Junior Operation" that would use three titanium screws to reattach Griffey's hamstring. For several weeks,
        Griffey's right leg was
        in a sling that kept it at a 90-degree angle, and he was not able to move the leg until late October. After an
        intense rehabilitation period, he returned for the 2005 season. In April, he hit .244 with one homer (on April
        30) and nine RBIs.</p>
      <p>Starting May 1, the 2005 season saw the resurgence of a healthy Griffey. His 35 home runs were his highest
        since his first year with the Reds as Griffey slowly moved up the career home run list. He ended the season
        tied with Mickey Mantle, after
        having passed Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, and Eddie Murray.</p>
      <p>Early in September, he strained a tendon in his left foot (an injury unrelated to his past hamstring and calf
        problems), and was listed as day-to-day for several weeks. On September 22, with the Reds out of playoff
        contention, the team decided to
        bench him for the rest of the season so he could immediately have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and a
        separate operation to repair scars from his 2004 hamstring operation. Still, his 128 games in 2005 were the
        most he had played since
        2000. Griffey's resurgence was recognized when he was named National League Comeback Player of the Year. He
        played in the World Baseball Classic for the American team that off-season with his father as a coach. Griffey
        batted .524, but the USA
        failed to reach the semifinals.</p>
      <p>During the second game of the 2006 regular season, Griffey hit home run #537, surpassing Mickey Mantle for
        12th on the all-time list. He returned on May 11 from a knee injury suffered April 12, and hit a walk-off
        three-run home run in the bottom
        of the 11th inning against the Washington Nationals. On June 5, Griffey tied Fred McGriff's record by hitting a
        home run in his 43rd different ballpark, at the St. Louis Cardinals' Busch Stadium. On June 19, Griffey hit
        career home run 548, tying
        him with Mike Schmidt, and then six days later passed Schmidt with 549. On June 27, he hit his 550th career
        home run against the Kansas City Royals. On September 25, 2006, Griffey hit his 27th home run of the season
        against Chicago Cubs relief
        pitcher Scott Eyre to tie Reggie Jackson for tenth on the all time home run list.</p>
      <p>Griffey's injuries continued in the 2006 off-season. While on holiday in the Bahamas with his family, he broke
        his wrist. Griffey said his hand felt fine and he expected to be ready to go for 2007 spring training.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Ryan Freel took over center field for the Reds, and
        Griffey Jr. was moved to right field. Reds manager Jerry Narron said that "I've got to do everything I can do
        to put our best club out
        there. My feeling is that with Ryan Freel out there, it gives us strong defense up the middle." Griffey changed
        his number from 30 to 3 to honor his three children. During the next two seasons, Griffey would wear number 42
        on April 15, beginning
        a tradition known as Jackie Robinson Day.</p>
      <p>On May 10, 2007, Griffey hit his sixth home run of the season and the 569th of his career, tying Rafael
        Palmeiro for ninth place on the career home runs list. He passed Palmeiro on May 13. Griffey tied Harmon
        Killebrew for eighth on the all-time
        list hitting his 573rd career home run on May 22. He then surpassed him on May 25.</p>
      <p>On June 22, 2007, Griffey made his first return to Seattle after his trade to the Reds. Before the game, the
        Mariners honored him with a 15-minute presentation which included a highlight reel of his playing career with
        the Mariners, a presentation
        of a "The House that Griffey Built" memorial by Mariners hall-of-famers and former teammates Jay Buhner and
        Edgar Martínez, and a 4-minute standing ovation from the sold-out crowd. Griffey did not expect such a welcome
        or a turnout by fans when
        he came back, and a short but emotional speech was given by Griffey afterwards. Many of the fans in attendance
        made signs professing their gratitude and adoration toward him with quotes such as: "The House that Griffey
        Built", "Seattle Junior",
        and "Griffey we miss you." Griffey went 1–5 in the game. On June 24, Griffey hit his 583rd and 584th career
        home runs, tying and passing Mark McGwire for 7th place on the all-time career home run list.</p>
      <p>Following the Cincinnati Reds versus Seattle Mariners series from June 22–24, 2007, a fan movement emerged
        petitioning Mariners' management to bring Griffey back. Over 1,900 signatures were collected on a fan
        vid-blog/petition.</p>
      <p>Griffey received the most votes of any player in the National League for the 2007 All-Star balloting and on
        the July 10 game, he went on to drive in two runs for the National League. On July 16, 2007, Ken Griffey Jr.
        hit his 587th home run to pass
        Frank Robinson for 6th place on the all-time home run list. On July 18, 2007, Griffey hit his 2,500th hit, a
        first-inning single off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz.</p>
      <p>On September 19, 2007, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Griffey fielded a Derrek Lee single in right field,
        then suddenly went down in pain. The injury, first thought to be a lower abdominal strain, was later revealed
        to be a season-ending groin
        strain. This marked one of many seasons in Cincinnati in which Griffey had to end the year on the disabled
        list. Griffey ended the 2007 season with 593 career home runs.</p>
      <p>On August 22, 2007, Griffey was selected as an all-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, on a list of nine players
        considered the greatest defensive players in the last fifty years. He finished the season with 78 runs, 146
        hits, 24 doubles, one triple,
        30 home runs, 93 RBIs, and a .277 batting average.</p>
      <p>On April 4, 2008, Ken Griffey Jr. passed Reggie Jackson for 16th on the all-time list after driving in his
        1,702nd RBI. On June 9, Griffey hit his 600th home run on a 3–1 pitch from Mark Hendrickson of the Florida
        Marlins in the first inning at
        Land Shark Stadium in Miami. Fans of both teams gave him a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>Despite being ranked second in the National League All-Star voting for outfielders for most of the first half
        of the season, Griffey finished fourth with 2,907,746 ballots, 87,000 votes behind Kosuke Fukudome. He was not
        selected to the All-Star
        Game as a reserve. At the All-Star Break, Griffey was batting .239 with 12 home runs and 42 RBIs. "I always
        have a backup plan...If you can't hit a tough lefty, bunt. If you can't hit a tough righty, bunt. If you can't
        go to the All-Star Game,
        go to the Bahamas", Griffey said.</p>
      <p>On July 30, Griffey hit his 608th career home run in his last game for the Reds.</p>
      <p>Griffey was criticized by some for his effort during his stint with the Reds. Gregg Doyel had this to say of
        the years Griffey was with the Reds in comparison to the 2010 Reds team. "It's a different Reds team than the
        older, beer-bellied softball
        teams of recent years. Those Reds were Ken Griffey and Adam Dunn lounging on the clubhouse's leather couches,
        hitting home runs, misplaying balls in the outfield and thinking they had it all figured out, when all they
        knew how to do was lose."</p>
